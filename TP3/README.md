# Machine Learning LAB3: Polynomial Regression

In this repositiry, we looked at polynomila regression algorithm applied to the "Pressure" dataset from the public R library.
This repository is the solution of the LAB3.

## Data  visualization: pressure(temperature) graph


## Comments on the graph
We can see that the data follows an exponential growth, thus a linear regression won't be the best choice to find an optimal hyperplane. That explains the choice of polynomial regression that will fit better the divergence of the data.
