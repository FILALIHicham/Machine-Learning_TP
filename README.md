# Machine-Learning LAB1: Classification Algorithms

In this repository, we implemented the basic ML algorithms of binary classification:

- Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- Pocket Learning Algorithm
- Adaline Learning Algorithm (Delta Rule variant)

The ```main.py``` and ```data.py``` files are respectively used to use the methods and to generate either lineary separable and/or unseparable data.
